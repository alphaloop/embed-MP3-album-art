Embeds album artwork, located using the Music Brainz and Cover Art Archive APIs, into a library of MP3 files using ID3 metadata tags.

This is a Python script which scans a directory tree for MP3 files, reads their metadata and attempts to look-up the album cover for any files that don't have one from the Music Brainz and Cover Art Archive APIs. If the album artwork for a given file is found, the image is embeded into the MP3 file as the front cover artwork. No changes are made to files that already have a front cover image.

Installation
The script has been tested with Python 2.7.12 and requires the musicbrainzngs and eyed3 Python libraries, which can be installed using pip as follows:
$ pip install musicbrainzngs eyeD3

Usage
$ ./embed.py <path to root MP3 directory>
